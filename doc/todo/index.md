Great website! There's plenty on here I didn't know about too after almost 4 years of living here. Only things I can think to add which I didn't see (but may have missed) Walk up to Pen Dinas, nature walk routes by Morrisons along the Rhiedol, the Marina, skate park by Starling cloud, The pink ice cream shop with the pink cow outside which I can't remember the name of, the old council building/'little' library, the tennis courts near by, Aberystwyth football club/ground, could also show the various parks and fields we have available too such as the ones in Penparcau or the uni fields that are accessible.

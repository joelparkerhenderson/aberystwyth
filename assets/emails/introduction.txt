Shwmae,

I live in Aberystwyth and I'm creating a web directory of local places. Would you be open to taking a look, to see if the listing for you is what you want? I can adjust it as you wish.

My goal is to help people learn more about what to do in Aber, especially now that we have good sunshine and so many people are visiting. <3 

Diolch yn fawr, 
Joel
